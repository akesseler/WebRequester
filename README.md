## WebRequester

The _Plexdata WebRequester_ is a program that is able to perform independent HTTP requests and 
represents therefore an alternative to _Postman_.

In fact, _Postman_ is a really good tool for testing API requests. However, that tool seems to be 
overloaded with features and functions and each new update reinforces this feeling. Reason enough 
to write an own tool that supports only essential thinks: firing single requests against an API.

### Features

* The separation into projects and sections is possible.
* The import of _Postman_ collections (v2 and v2.1).
* The import and export of projects.
* The automatic saving of all projects and settings.
* The cross-sectional sharing of authorizations.
* And finally the support of variables.

In addition, this program is _portable_ as well as _self-contained_ and therefore no installation 
is required.
